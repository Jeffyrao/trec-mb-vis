<h2>Visualizing the Temporal Distribution of Relevance Judgments from the TREC 2011 Microblog Track</h2>

<p>The visualizations below show the temporal distribution of
relevance judgments for each topic from the TREC 2011 Microblog Track.
Each topic is associated with a query time, represented by the right
edge of each figure. The <i>x</i>-axis shows time <i>prior</i> to the
query time, in days. Dots show tweets that were retrieved by
participating teams and evaluated by assessors (i.e., the pools):
green dots are relevant, red dots are highly relevant. The vertical
position of the dots has no meaning; jitter is added only to prevent
overlap. The underlying blue bars shows the distribution of relevant
and highly-relevant tweets as a histogram.</p>
